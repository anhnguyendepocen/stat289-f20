For the second part of the semester, most of our class time will consist of
working through several large, complex datasets in small groups. To facilitate
this, we will use fixed groups based (roughly) on student preferences. I
expect you to interact and collaborate with your group during class; this will
be a major component of your participation grade. For the projects themselves,
you will have the option to work with your group, with a subset of your group,
or alone according to your preference.

Note: Students taken the course asychronously should continue to work through
the notebooks as usual on their own. If feasible, of course, you are welcome
to form an independent group of asychronous students for the purpose of the
projects.

The groups are listed below for your information. They should populate
automatically in Zoom.
