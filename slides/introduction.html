# Welcome!

Welcome to Introduction to Data Science!

It is certainly shaping up to be a strange year. I am looking forward to the semester and
hoping to finding was to get to know you all remotely and to make this course as fun and
rewarding an experience as it usually is.

--

Today we are going to go through these notes, which give a long-form version of the
posted syllabus.

You should feel free to ask questions at any point during the semester. Please either
(i) use the Zoom raise hand feature, (ii) post your question or just a question mark in the
chat window, or (iii) wait for a pause and shout out directly.

---

# Website

We will get to all of the course details (grades, assignments, expectations, and so on)
soon. Before that, as reminder from my emails to the class, all of the materials, for the
course can be found on the course website:

- https://statsmaths.github.io/stat289-f20/

Make sure to bookmark this somewhere easy to access. The page will remain online
indefinitely for your reference following the semester.

# Part 2: Course Content

---

# Description

Data science is an interdisciplinary field concerned with drawing knowledge from data and
communicating those results to various audiences. Data science needs to be learned
*by doing* data science.

--

This course broadly covers the entire process of collecting, cleaning, visualising,
modelling, and presenting information for data. It has a MATH designation but is not a
mathematics course. The focus is on applied statistics and data analysis rather than a
detailed study of symbolic mathematics.

--

By the end of the semester you will feel confident collecting, analysing, and writing
about datasets from a variety of fields. You will be able to use these skills to address
data-driven problems in a wide range of application domains.

---

# Example analysis: Hans Roslin (2004)

As an example of the kinds of analysis that we want to make possible, let's watch this short
video presentation by Hans Roslin showing an analysis of 400 years of macroeconomic data:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo

Do pay attention, as I will use this video as a reference throughout the next few weeks.

---

# Outline

The course content is broken roughly into two parts. In the first we learn so core
techniques for working with data. These notes take about 6 weeks of the semester to cover,
focusing on four main tasks:

1. Creating and organising data using a tabular data model.
2. Learning and applying a theory for data visualisation (Grammar of Graphics).
3. Learning and applying a theory for data manipulation (data table verbs).
4. Learning and applying a method for storytelling with data.

--

And in the second part, we will apply these core methods to specific tasks. These include:

5. Methods for working with textual data.
6. Methods for working with spatial data.
7. Methods for working with network data.
8. Techniques for collecting and organising data from a web-based API.

The specific applications may change slightly based on the pace of the course and student
interest.

---

# Prerequisites and MATH209

The pace of this course assumes that students have had some prior exposure to a programming
language and have taken a course in which statistical techniques were applied to the
analysis of real-world datasets. However, **this is not a strict prerequisite**! Just be
prepared to put in some extra effort earlier on in the semester.

We receive a lot of questions about the relationship between MATH209 and MATH289. The first
focuses a bit more on statistical inference, whereas the second is more oriented towards
building a toolkit of computational models for working with data. The exact material covered
in either depends as much as on who the instructor is as it does the course number.

# Part 3: Format

---

# Online Format

Due to social distancing guidelines and the need to maximize flexibility, Data Science is
being taught using online instruction. Classes will be presented remotely over Zoom. A link
to the Zoom room is provided on the course website. A numeric password was sent via email
to the class roster.

The course has been designed so that only minimal changes will be needed in the event that
some or all students need to return home before the normal end of the semester.

---

# Course Format

Most class meetings will consist of working through a set of course notes and questions in
the form of an *Rmarkdown* file (more on this later). This file will introduce new concepts
and then ask us to apply these concepts to various datasets. Everyone in the class will
have their own version of the file, and you are expected to follow along with the pace of
the course.

--

We may not finish all of the questions during class. In this case, it is recommended to
finish the material as homework. However, there will be no formal handing in of these
assignments.

--

During the course I will call on students to share their work. There is no expectation for
you to share your video, but you should be prepared to share your screen at any time with
the class.

--

Students are not allowed to record the text or video of the class without prior permission.
When permission is granted, recordings must not be shared and shall be destroyed at the
end of the semester.

---

# Grades

There will be several class projects assigned throughout the semester. Each project will be
distributed with a rubric and assigned a total number of overall points. Projects will be
submitted through Box. At the end of the semester, the overall project grade will be
determined by adding together the total number or earned points and dividing by the total
number of available points.

The final grade will be computed by the following formula:

- **Projects** 70%
- **Participation** 30%

---

# Alternative Grading

Some students may be unable to travel to campus due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. It is
the University's policy that all enrolled students should be prepared to attend courses
remotely from wherever they are; in reality this may be difficult due to shifted
time-zones and situations at home.

As an alternative, students will be given the option to follow the course material
asychronously and receive a final grade based entirely on their project scores. In the
interest of equity, this option is open to all students, but must be chosen during the
first week of the semester.

You will have a chance to select this option at the end of today's class.

---

# Attendance Policies

For students electing the standard grading scheme, satisfactory participation includes:

- missing a maximum of two course meetings
- arriving on time for class
- actively following along with the day's materials
- raising questions (in the Zoom chat or verbally) when stuck
- being prepared to share your screen when called on

Students will be called on in a random order to share their progress through the day's
assignment.

Participation grades are entirely focused on your *attempt* to engage with and follow the
material; this not an intended to penalise anyone during the learning process. A full
grading rubric for attendance will be posted during the second week of the semester.

---

# Office Hours

I will hold open office hours during the semester via Zoom. This will likely be held in
the evening to accommodate students from alternative timezones and to avoid class conflicts.
Office hours are, of course, entirely optional. If you choose to attend, please
arrive at the start of the listed session so that there is enough time for everyone to get
their questions answered. You may leave the session at any time.

Office hour times will be announced after the results of the student poll that will be given
at the end of today's class.

If you have questions of a personal nature (that is, not about the course material), please
reach out via email with your question or a request to meet.

---

# Special Circumstances

I completely understand that extenuating circumstances may arise throughout the semester
that effect your ability to attend class or follow along with the pace of the course.
Please contact me as soon as possible so that we can find the best path forward.

---

# Pace of the Course

Students in this course have a wide variety of background in statistics, mathematics, and
computer science. With this in mind, it is important to consider a few things about the
pace of the course.

First of all, my notes assume that you have no background in statistical programming.
Therefore:

- If this material is new to you, take advantage of the first few weeks to catch up. Ask
questions, attend office hours, review the notes in-between course sections.
- If the material seems mostly like review, do not incorrectly assume the entire semester
will be equally as easy for you. Be prepared for the pace to speed up as we reach material
that is new to you.

---

# Pace of the Course, cont.

Secondly, if you are already familiar with programming in R, it is likely that I will be
teaching you different ways to do things than you have previously learned.

- I expect everyone to learn the specific methods presented in this course.
- Pay close attention to the packages and functions I am using. They are designed to work
together in a very particular way.
- It is likely that alternative methods will appear to be fine the first time we encounter
something (making a scatterplot, filtering data, ect.), but will break down in more advanced
applications.

---

# Frequently Asked Questions

- **Is there a textbook for the course?** No, we will be using my own notes and references
to other freely available resources.
- **Is there a final exam?** No.
- **When are the projects due?** The last project will be due during the last week of class.
Dates and instructions for other projects depend on the pace of the course.
- **What software will we be using?** We will be writing code using the R programming
language using a new platform called RStudio Cloud. More on this next time. Classes will
be held using Zoom and projects will be submitted using Box.
