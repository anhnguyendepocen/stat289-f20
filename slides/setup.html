# The R Programming Language

---

# What is R

R is an open-source programming language focused on data analysis. It is
a very popular language in academia, industry, and government work. Typically
somewhere in the top-20 most popular programming languages (TIOBE: 8th, GitHub: 12th,
StackOverflow: 16th).

R is also a relatively old language. It was first developed under the name "S" at Bell Labs
by Rick Becker, John Chambers, and Alan Wilks in 1976. The language was originally
closed-source, prompting Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman to develop and free, open-source
reimplementation of the language in 1993.

---

# What can we do with R?

In theory, we can do almost anything in R. It is a fully functioning programming
language with a robust set of third-party libraries and tools. The language's strength
is, however, in manipulating and modelling data. This is what we will be using R for
this semester.

As mentioned in the first class, this course is *not* strictly about teaching R. Rather,
we are learning techniques in data science that we are applying within the R language.
We will not be spending much time discussing the lower-level mechanisms in R.

---

# Components

It will be helpful to understand some of the components of the software we will be using
this semester. There are three different things that are needed, all of which are
provided as free and open-source software:

1. The core R programming language itself.
2. RStudio: an additional piece of software that provides tools for writing R
code (i.e., an integrated development environment).
3. Additional third-party extensions to R known as *packages*.

---

# RStudio Cloud

Typically during this class we spend a while getting all of these components setup on
your personal laptops. This semester we are trying a new approach using a service called
**RStudio Cloud**. This is a way to access a version of R that is installed and managed
by a third party through the browser. UR has bought a license for all of us to use this
service for free for (at least) the duration of semester.

The hope is that this service will make it easier given the unique needs of the semester.
Usually when students run into issues, we can work together to debug things during office
hours. In a worst-case scenario, I can loan out spare laptops or have students share a
computer in class and use the labs for assignments. Using a third-party service should
avoid these issues.

To stress: All of the code and material we are working with will work without access to
RStudio Cloud. We are not locking you into a paid-service. I will provide details are the
end of these notes and at the end of the semester for anyone who does want to setup R on
their own machine.

# RStudio Cloud Setup

Now, let's setup RStudio Cloud. This should be a relatively straightforward process:

1. Click on the RStudio Cloud link at the top of the course website.
2. This will open a login page. Assuming you do not yet have an account, click on the
Sign up link and create one with your `richmond.edu` email address.
3. Pick a username, which can be anything you would like.
4. After signing in, you should be prompted to "Join Space". Select yes.
5. Now, click on the projects and select the button next to "Introduction Data
Science" to create your own version of the course notes.

If you get stuck at any point with these steps, I suggest going back to the course website
and clicking on the RStudio Cloud link again. Sometimes after creating a new account in
does not re-direct you at first to the course website.

---

# RStudio Cloud Setup

You should now have a new project created that contains some starter code. This is where
we will start most classes going forward. For the rest of today's notes we will walk
through an introduction to R using the first notebook.

In the future, you should be able to return to this screen by clicking on the RStudio
Cloud link on the website and logging in.

If you get stuck with this step, please reach out as soon as possible.

---

# Updating Notes

At the start of each class, you should open and run the file `notebook00.Rmd`. This will
download any new materials that are needed. Usually, we will jump right into a day's
notebook during class; all of the notes and questions will be embedded directly into
the new file(s).

# Local Setup (optional)

# Local Setup (optional)

Some students may choose to run RStudio locally on their own machine rather than logging
into RStudio cloud. This is perfectly fine, and does have several advantages: will work
after the end of the semester, no need to internet access, and may be faster if you have
a newer laptop.

Note, however, that I will not be able to offer much technical support for alternative
setups. I recommend setting up RStudio Cloud even if you intend to work locally in case
you run into software problems later on. This is particularly true for students running
Windows, which may run into unique errors during some of the later lessons on web scraping
and text analysis.

---

# Local Setup (optional)

In order to setup the course materials locally you should:

1. Install the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/) language from CRAN.
2. Install [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
3. Download and uncompress the zip file from the course website.
4. Open the file `setup.R` in RStudio and run both chunks of code. Note that you may
need to open the Console at the bottom and respond to a question about updating packages
(you probably want to answer "yes").

Now you can open the other notebooks just as we are doing on RStudio Cloud.
