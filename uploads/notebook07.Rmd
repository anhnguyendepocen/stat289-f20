## Getting Started

Before running this notebook, select "Session > Restart R and Clear Output" in
the menu above to start a new R session. This will clear any old data sets and
give us a blank slate to start with.

After starting a new session, run the following code chunk to load the
libraries and data that we will be working with today.

```{r, include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)
library(smodels)
library(stringi)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
options(dplyr.summarise.inform = FALSE)

food <- read_csv(file.path("data", "food.csv"))
food_prices <- read_csv(file.path("data", "food_prices.csv"))
```

I have set the options `include=FALSE` and `message=FALSE` to avoid cluttering
the solutions with all the output from this code.

# Storytelling with Data

## Overview

Most classes in statistics and data science spend a lot of time discussing and
practicing the technical skills of working with data such as building complex
graphics, collecting and cleaning data, and building inferential and predictive
models. Often little to no time is spent discussing how to present and use the
output of these analyses. Today's notes are an attempt to partially rectify
this. We will continue to make the presentation of our data a part of our
discussion throughout the course.

Todays material comes from a number of sources, which I suggest you check out
if you are interested in studying these topics further. Specifically:

- *Storytelling with Data* by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic
- *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* by Edward Tufte
- *Beautiful Evidence* by Edward Tufte
- *The Functional Art* by Alberto Cairo
- *Dear Data* by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec

I can share digital copies of these with students who are interested.

Exploratory versus Explanatory

1. Choosing effective visuals
2. Reduce clutter
3. Focusing attention
4. Use narrative logic


### Choosing effective visual

Numbers
Tables (regression model?)
Scatterplot
Scatterplot with bestfit line or curve
Line plot(s)
Slopegraph (line plot with only two time points)
Bar plot
Confidence interval plot
Histogram, Box-plot, ribbon plot

### Reduce clutter

Use minimal themes (`theme_sm` or `theme_minimal`)
Visual order of categories (`fct_inorder` and/or `fct_lump`)
Avoid legends if possible `show.legend = FALSE`

### Focusing Attention

Now that we have decluttered our tables and visualizations, it is
time to think about where we want to focus the attention of our
audience. This should help focus on the key take-away point that
are associated with our story. Two ways to focus attention are
through the use of color and annotations, both of which we will
focus on here.

When using a visualization to make an argument or tell a story,
I typically use three colors:

- **black** for titles, axes, labels, and annotations
- **light grey** to show data used primarily for context and
for less-important annotations; I recommend something between
"grey80" and "grey90"
- one **highlight color** to show a particular part of the data
of interest to the story; can also use to give particular
attention to labels or annotations

You have already seen approach in several examples from the last
few notebooks.

Generally you should consider using the same highlight color across
all of your visualizations. While one highlight is often sufficient,
there are cases for using multiple. You can use a lighter shade of
the highlight color to show a secondary subset related to the first.
It is also sometimes useful to use 2 or 3 different highlight colors
if you have two groups of data to differentiate or if there are
canonical colors that will make the plot quickly understandable
(i.e., blue and red for Democrats and Republicans).

Annotations are short textual labels or descriptions that are
put on top of a plot to explain a region of the plot or a specific
subset of the data. These can be used to give more context to the
plot by giving descriptive names to extreme corners, for example
the "healthy-wealthy" and "sick-poor" descriptions from Hans
Roslin's presentation. They can also guide the audience to the
purpose of a visualization by making an in-line argument. These
annotations can be added as layers to plots in R, but it is often
better and easier to add them afterwards using a different piece
of software.

Finally, we can also add manual guidelines to the plot to focus
attention to a point of change in the plot. These often take the
form of dashed horizontal or vertical lines. These can be created
by adding explicit geometry layers, such as:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Just examples ; these will not run unless added to a plot
geom_hline(yintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed")
geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dotted")
geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "longdash")
```

These are particularly helpful for showing a particular time
point when using a date or time variable or for showing a
line of parity with a slope of 1 and intercept of zero.

### Narrative logic

Three to five minutes. That approximately all the time you will
generally have to tell a data-driven story. That's about how
much time (at most) that I spend looking through a job application,
scanning a paper, and reading most news articles. When giving
presentations in academia or industry, you may have a slightly
longer time-slot (10-20 minutes), but most of that will be spent
setting up and having time for Q&A. Even in the rare cases where
you have more time (teaching a class, for example!), this is
often best spent telling a sequence of 3-5 minute stories such
as this one.

The key to making an effective story with data is to start by
summarizing the key point of our presentation as one "big idea".
This should take the form of a single sentence that gives your
point of view and the desired outcome that you want your
audience to walk away with. You may never actually present this
big idea sentence, but it is helpful to write it down somewhere
to clarify the main thesis of your story.

How should you structure your limited time? There are a number
of approaches; here I will outline one that I find to be a good
starting point for most applications. I tend to think of the
presentation as consisting of a small set of 1 to 3 slides. Each
slide consists of a table or plot, narrated by a paragraph with
a topic sentence and several supporting sentences. Depending on
the application, the main points can be included on the slide in
an abbreviated, bullet point form.

If you have slightly more time or space, this should be used to
build out a longer contextual introduction and/or conclusions.
In an oral presentation, this may be an outline or conclusions
slide. For a paper, it could be a longer background section or




### Example

Let's put together all of the elements in this chapter to produce a plot of wheat prices
that highlights the differences in prices following WWI and following WWII. We will add
a complete set of titles and captions. I selected the second color by picking the
complementary color of the maroon used for the first time period.

```{r}
food_prices %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, wheat)) +
    geom_line(color = "grey85") +
    geom_line(
      color = "maroon",
      data = filter(food_prices, between(year, 1919, 1939))
    ) +
    geom_line(
      color = "maroon",
      data = filter(food_prices, between(year, 1945, 2015))
    ) +
    labs(
      title = "Wheat Price Index, 1850 to 2015",
      subtitle = "Commodity prices are given as a price index relative to real prices in 1900",
      caption = "Jacks, D.S. (2019), \"A Typology of Real Commodity Prices in the Long Run.\" Cliometrica 13(2), 202-220.",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Price Index of Wheat (1900 = 100)"
    )
```

To finish the plot off, and make it look particularly professional, it would be nice to add
annotations explaining the main points that you want your audience to take-away from the plot.
It is possible to do this directly in R with **ggplot2** annotations, but I find these somewhat
awkward and time consuming. A better solution is to open the figure in another program such as
Microsoft PowerPoint or the macOS Finder. Here is a plot I made by adding text labels and an
arrow to the plot using the macOS Finder application:

![](images/wheat_price.png)

Notice that the plot both shows all of the data for the viewer, but guides them to the specific
points of interest that we are interested. The subpoint explaining the peak int he 1970s is shown
in a smaller font size, and in a dark grey, because it is secondary to the points I wanted to make
about the overall trends in the two post-war periods.






# Practice

## Load Datasets

We will work with the largest cities datasets:

```{r, message=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_minimal())

cities <- read_csv(file.path("data", "largest_cities.csv"))
```

We will also work with the entire U.S. cities dataset:

```{r, message=FALSE}
us <- read_csv(file.path("data", "us_city_population.csv"))
```

Please refer to notebook02 for more information about these datasets and how
these datasets are organized.

## Labels and themes

```{r question-1}

```
